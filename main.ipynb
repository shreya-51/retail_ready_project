    "1. we only include requirements that exist in the PDF\n",
    "2. we extract all requirements from the PDF\n",
    "\n",
    "To check for requirement 1, the evals are set up to parse each of the sources returned alongside each requirement and go back into the PDF and make sure it actually exists. More layers could be added to this (i.e. check that the source is in the correct section), but I found that this works pretty well without these layers, as least for this PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evals don't currently include a check for requirement 2, but a possible approach is to take each section, its outputted requirements, and ask a model to verify that we didn't miss any requirements. From intuition, this should provide decent baseline performance. If not, another approach is to remove each source we did encounter from the parsed PDF and inspect the remaining text for any missing requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many more layers of evals can be added both using LLMs and without LLMs based on how more PDFs act under this pipeline. Since the PDF parsing is not at the time the user uses the app and only happens once for each PDF, cost and latency is probably not a large concern when adding more LLM calls, if those calls result in a significant increase in output accuracy and product quality."
